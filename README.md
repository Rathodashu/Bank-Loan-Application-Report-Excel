✅ Bank Loan Report Dashboard – MS Excel Project Highlights
📊 Built an end-to-end interactive Bank Loan Report dashboard using Microsoft Excel, enabling management to monitor key lending KPIs and portfolio performance.

🔍 Designed Dashboard 1: Summary, featuring dynamic KPIs including:

Total Loan Applications (MTD & MoM),

Total Funded Amount,

Total Amount Received,

Average Interest Rate,

Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),

Good vs Bad Loan categorization with detailed metrics.

✅ Developed Good Loan & Bad Loan KPIs by classifying loans using Loan Status as:

Good: "Fully Paid" and "Current"

Bad: "Charged Off"

Included insights like funded amount, application count, and total amount received.

📋 Created a Loan Status Grid View that provides a breakdown of metrics such as:

Loan Applications, Funded Amount, Amount Received, MTD metrics, Average Interest Rate, and DTI Ratio by each loan status.

📈 Dashboard 2: Overview – Visual Analytics with Excel Charts
📅 Line Chart for Monthly Trend Analysis: Showcased monthly patterns in loan applications, funded amounts, and amount received based on loan issue dates.

🗺️ Filled Map (via Excel Geography tools): Displayed regional analysis of lending activity across different states.

🍩 Donut Chart for Loan Term Analysis: Compared 36-month and 60-month loan statistics to understand distribution by term.

📊 Bar Charts for Employment Length & Loan Purpose: Visualized how employment history and loan purposes affect application volume and loan value.

🏡 Tree Map for Home Ownership Analysis: Highlighted the influence of ownership status (Own, Rent, Mortgage) on loan behavior and funding.

📘 Dashboard 3: Details – Holistic Snapshot
🧾 Designed a Details Dashboard to deliver a user-friendly view of borrower profiles, loan characteristics, and performance metrics in a single, filterable interface.

🔄 Implemented slicers, drop-downs, and dynamic formulas (SUMIFS, AVERAGEIFS, IF, COUNTIFS, etc.) to enhance interactivity and enable deep dives into the dataset.
